# CENSUS: `deps-build` — run file

**Brief:** `findings/CENSUS-BRIEF.md` rev 1. Read it first. This file overrides it where they conflict.

**Subject:** dependency management, dependency discovery, build design, build management, test design,
test management — **as your repo actually does them**, not as they ought to be done.

## §R Roster, prefixes, paths

| surveyor | prefix | file |
|---|---|---|
| `paperkit` | `PK-` | `findings/deps-build/paperkit-deps-build.md` |
| `substrate` | `SB-` | `findings/deps-build/substrate-deps-build.md` |
| `cassian-observability` | `CO-` | `findings/deps-build/cassian-observability-deps-build.md` |
| `mtools` | `MT-` | `findings/deps-build/mtools-deps-build.md` |
| `linux-sources` | `LS-` | `findings/deps-build/linux-sources-deps-build.md` |
| `rosettapkg` | `RP-` | `findings/deps-build/rosettapkg-deps-build.md` |
| **apex** — a fresh session holding **no leg** | `AX-` | `findings/deps-build/deps-build-apex.md` |

**Conventions, fixed here so nobody negotiates them peer-to-peer:**

- Filenames exactly as above. ⚑ Not `DEPS.md`, not `<party>-consolidated.md`, not one file per round.
- **One file per surveyor.** Draft privately, revise freely, file once.
- IDs are `<PREFIX><n>` — `PK-01`, `SB-14`. ⚑ **Directory-wide, not file-local.** Never renumber
  another party's IDs into your own scheme.
- Quote style: verbatim in blockquotes, typos preserved, provenance class tagged per brief §7.
- Everything lands under `findings/deps-build/`.

⚑ **Answer the roster question in your filing:** name any party you believe should be on this roster
and is not, and what you think they hold. The roster is the index the span is computed over; the last
run of this machinery omitted a party that held directives no other party could cite, and nothing in
that survey could have discovered it.

## §Q The question

⚑ **Survey yourself.** Report how *your repo* does these things. Do not survey the others — `§R`
tells you who else is reporting and that is all you need to know about them.

**I do not know what the union looks like; that is why I am asking all of you.** That is the honest
statement of the target, and per `§C` it is a complete question.

Cover, for your own repo, whatever of this you actually have — **absence is a finding, reported per
brief §5**:

1. **Dependency declaration** — where a dependency is named, in what file, in what language. Pinned
   or floating, and what pins it. Lockfiles: which, generated how, verified by what.
2. **Dependency discovery** — how you find out what you depend on. Import scanning, manifest reading,
   a tool, a person, nothing. ⚑ Include **implicit** dependencies: a binary on `PATH`, a service on a
   port, a file at a fixed path, an env var, a network endpoint. Those are dependencies that no
   manifest names.
3. **Dependency acquisition** — vendoring, fetching, a registry, a wheel, a corpus fetch, a symlink,
   a copy. What happens on a cold machine.
4. **Hermeticity** — what your build can reach that it does not declare, and how you know. A gate that
   passes by *not running* is the specific case to look for.
5. **Build design** — the graph, the units, the tiers. What is cached, what is not, and **why not**.
   Remote vs local execution. What invalidates what.
6. **Test design** — what a test is in your repo, what a claim is, how one binds to the other. Is a
   test proven *falsifiable*, or only observed to pass?
7. **Gate design** — what refuses, when, and what it reads to decide. Pre-commit, CI, a hook, a
   selftest. ⚑ **Has it ever fired?** A gate that has never refused anything is a configuration, not
   a gate.
8. **What you re-derived** — machinery you built because a shared thing did not offer it, or you did
   not know it did. ⚑ **This is the highest-value item in the whole census** and it is the one nobody
   records. A re-derivation is a defect report about the shared object whether or not you fix it.
9. **What you declined** — a shared mechanism you looked at and did not take, **and why**. A decline
   with a reason is a design constraint; a decline without one is fragmentation.
10. **What binds you** — the constraint that actually limits your build today. Not the one you would
    fix first; the one that decides your throughput.

## §C The construction — two phases, and phase 1 is not the deliverable

**Phase 1 — the span.** Build `A`: what every leg holds, as a correspondence table with a **witness
per identification**. State non-identifications explicitly, with reasons. Publishable, verifiable,
and **not the answer** — it is the surface the glue is taken over.

**Phase 2 — the glue.** Glue the legs along the published `A`. It **grows**: every leg's contribution
is carried, including the ones only one leg holds. No admission bar. ⚑ **If the output is smaller
than the largest leg, phase 2 did not run.**

⚑ **Carry-uncheckable-testimony.** A claim held by one leg that the apex cannot verify is carried,
tagged with its witness and its leg, and **not adjudicated**. Unverifiable ≠ false. Where two legs
disagree about one item, both stand in the divergence register with their denominators and
instruments. **An identification with no witness is over-gluing; a missed one is duplication. Both are
recorded, neither is guessed.**

## §W Window, and why

⚑ **UNBOUNDED. No date bound.**

**Justification:** the previous run of this machinery bounded every leg to a single day by nobody's
instruction, and the directive that *created the artifact under study* sat seven days outside it,
quoted in none of four filings. A window is a property of the query; findings inside one are not facts
about the subject. Build and dependency machinery here has antecedents going back months, and the
origin of a given tool is exactly the thing a bounded sweep destroys.

**The antecedent probe is still required** (brief §6): for each artifact you cite, search unbounded
for its *origin*, and report it. Unbounded window does not excuse skipping the probe — it makes it
cheap.

## §X Context you would not otherwise have

Facts no leg can infer from its own corpus:

- **One physical host.** Every party runs on the same machine — one CPU, one memory, one zram, one
  swapfile, one load average. A per-repo answer to *"what does my build need"* is a measurement of the
  box, not of the repo.
- **The current binding constraint is CPU, not memory.** Since boot: CPU stall ~59.7% of uptime
  against memory stall ~0.094%. ⚑ That is evidence the memory work **succeeded**, not that it was
  misaimed.
- **A shared remote executor exists** — BuildBuddy on k3s, reachable at `grpc://127.0.0.1:31985`,
  BES at the same, results UI on `:31080`, metrics on `:31464`. ⚑ **`--remote_local_fallback` is
  ruled out**: it evades the scheduler and consumes resources on the machine the scheduler protects.
  Some parties are on this config and some are not; that difference is a finding, not an error to
  hide.
- **The executor is currently degraded** — a ghost scheduler shard from a retired quadlet persists in
  Valkey, so a fraction of `EnqueueTaskReservation` calls return `Unavailable`. ⚑ If your remote
  builds are failing, that is a known environmental fact and **not evidence about your configuration**.
- **`mtools` is the intern table** — the repo where clean, granular, canonically-packaged tools live
  so that consumers reference rather than copy. That is the destination this census informs.
- **`membudget` exists and is shared** — an admission loop with pluggable predicates (memory, load
  average, named-artefact claim). It is **not installable**; consumers vendor it. If you vendored it,
  that is a `§Q`-3 and `§Q`-8 answer.
- **Retired, do not report as live:** the host `buildbuddy` quadlet (superseded by the k8s
  deployment); `mat230` and `mat260`.
- ⚑ **A prior four-party census over `membudget` is filed in `findings/membudget/`.** It is
  **testimony, not citation**, for this survey. Do not treat its conclusions as settled input — and
  do not read peers' legs from *this* survey until the freeze.

## §V Revision log — ⚑ corrections land here, not in messages

| rev | when | what changed | affects |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2026-09-06 | initial | — |
| 2 | 2026-09-06 | `rosettapkg` dispatched later than the other five — no session existed at rev 1. **Byte-identical message, no substitution.** Recorded as a dispatch-time asymmetry, not a content one. | apex §accounting; `rosettapkg`'s brief §9 disclosure |

⚑ **rev 2 is an accounting entry, not an instruction.** No leg needs to re-read anything. It exists
so the apex can distinguish *"filed late"* from *"had less notice"* — and so `rosettapkg`'s own §9
disclosure can state the input asymmetry rather than the apex inferring it. **All six parties
received the same bytes; only the clock differed.**

**Every filing cites the revision it was written against, in its first line.**

⚑ **An instruction that reaches you outside this file is not in force until it is appended here and
you cite the new revision. Echo it, then act on it.**
